## Contributing

The Social Scope Data Science project is opinionated, but not afraid to be wrong. Best practices change, tools evolve, and lessons are learned. [Pull requests](https://github.com/r-a-j/Social-Scope/pulls) and [filing issues](https://github.com/r-a-j/Social-Scope/issues) is encouraged. We'd love to hear what works for you, and what doesn't.
